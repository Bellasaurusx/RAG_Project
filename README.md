Document Queried

The document used for this project was The Time Machine by H.G. Wells. This classic novel explores the concept of time travel through the adventures of an unnamed protagonist, referred to as the Time Traveller. The book was processed into chunks and used as the basis for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system, allowing for natural language queries to extract relevant information.

How the Program Works

This program functions as a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system, combining cosine similarity with sentence embeddings and a Hugging Face language model to generate responses based on user queries. The steps involved in this process are:

The document is split into chunks to facilitate retrieval.

Each chunk is embedded using the SentenceTransformers model.

When a user inputs a query, its embedding is computed and compared against the stored embeddings using cosine similarity from scikit-learn.

The top three most relevant chunks are retrieved based on similarity scores.

The retrieved chunks, along with the user’s query, are passed to a Hugging Face transformer model (google/flan-t5-small) to generate a response.

The response is displayed to the user.

What is Cosine Similarity?

Cosine similarity is a mathematical measure used to determine how similar two vectors are in a multi-dimensional space. In this program, it is used to compare the user’s query embedding with stored document chunk embeddings. A higher cosine similarity score means the chunk is more relevant to the query.

Five Important Questions & AI-Generated Answers

What is cosine similarity, and why is it used in this program?Cosine similarity measures the similarity between two vectors based on the cosine of the angle between them. In this program, it is used to determine how closely the query matches chunks of the document by comparing their embeddings.

What is SentenceTransformers, and how does it generate embeddings?SentenceTransformers is a Python library built on top of Hugging Face Transformers and PyTorch that enables efficient sentence embeddings. It converts text into a dense numerical vector representation, capturing semantic meaning for similarity comparisons.

How does chunking the document impact retrieval and response generation?Chunking helps break the document into manageable pieces, allowing for better retrieval accuracy. Without chunking, similarity searches would be performed on the entire document, which could dilute relevance scores.

Why does this program use a transformer model for response generation instead of directly returning the retrieved text?Transformers allow for a more natural, coherent response by integrating multiple relevant chunks and rephrasing them into a complete answer. Directly returning the text might not always form a meaningful response.

What potential improvements could be made to this system?Improvements could include fine-tuning the transformer model on domain-specific data, optimizing chunk size for better retrieval, and implementing more advanced ranking mechanisms beyond cosine similarity.

Analysis of System Performance

How Well Did the System Retrieve Relevant Content?

The retrieval system successfully identified relevant chunks from the text. However, some queries resulted in less meaningful chunks being included in the top results. This might be improved by fine-tuning the embedding model or adjusting chunk sizes.

Quality of Generated Responses

The responses were generally relevant but occasionally lacked specificity. For example, the system returned "The Time Machine" as a response when asked what the book was about, which is correct but not informative. When asked about the main character, it correctly identified "The Time Traveller." However, for more complex queries, the system struggled to provide detailed answers.

Possible Improvements

Better Query Understanding: Implementing a reranking model to prioritize the most contextually relevant chunks.

Fine-tuning the Transformer Model: Training the model on a dataset containing Q&A pairs specific to The Time Machine might improve response coherence.

Hybrid Retrieval Approach: Combining cosine similarity with another retrieval method, such as BM25, could enhance accuracy.

Conclusion

This project successfully implemented a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to answer questions about The Time Machine. While the system retrieved relevant chunks and generated responses, there is room for improvement in query understanding and response coherence. Fine-tuning the model and optimizing retrieval techniques could enhance its performance. Overall, this was an insightful exploration of using NLP techniques for information retrieval and text generation.
